# OpenRouter (OpenCode) — Multi-Angle Agentic Review

OpenCode runs an agentic shell. Use its subagent system if available (`@subagent`-style spawning); otherwise fall back to the sequential structure shown below. The output contract is identical to the other providers.

The shared header above lists prefetched artifacts, findings schema, blocking criteria, and the do-NOT-flag list. **Apply them verbatim.** Per-angle prompt bodies live at `$WOO_REVIEW_ACTION_PATH/prompts/angles/<angle>.md` in the bundled action repo.

**Host identifier:** default `opencode` (substitute into the credits line `<host>` placeholder per `_header.md`). When an OpenCode agent persona / subagent profile is identifiable (e.g. `mimo-v2.5`), append it in parentheses: `opencode (mimo-v2.5)`. Read the active profile from the OpenCode runtime when available; otherwise use the bare `opencode` slug.

**Provider / model accuracy.** This file's model table assumes OpenRouter + DeepSeek, but OpenCode can route to *any* provider/model (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, local, …). For the credits line, follow `_header.md`'s precedence (`WOO_REVIEW_PROVIDER` / `WOO_REVIEW_MODEL` env vars > OpenCode runtime introspection > this file's default > `unknown`) and report what the validator step actually ran on. Do NOT hard-code `openrouter` / `deepseek-v4-pro` into the credits line unless that is genuinely the active route — if mimo-v2.5 is wired to `anthropic` + `claude-sonnet-4-6`, those are the correct values.

## Model selection

OpenCode + OpenRouter can route per-subagent if the OpenCode runtime supports it. When spawning each angle / validator subagent, read its `tier:` frontmatter and resolve via the **Model Tiers** table in `_header.md`:

- `fast` → `openrouter/deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash`
- `standard` → `openrouter/deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro`
- `deep` → `openrouter/deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro` with `reasoning_effort: xhigh` (use `high` for a lower-cost reasoning pass)

OpenRouter exposes only two DeepSeek slugs — reasoning is a `reasoning_effort` parameter on the same `v4-pro` slug, not a separate model ID. DeepSeek V4 supersedes R1 — do not route to `deepseek-r1`. If the OpenCode build cannot route per-subagent or cannot pass `reasoning_effort`, fall back to a single model for the whole job and pin it to `openrouter/deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro`. `inputs.model` (action.yml) always overrides tier resolution.

**Per-repo override:** before applying any tier slug above, check `$OUTDIR/config.json` for `models.<tier>` and use that slug instead when present (`jq -r '.models.fast // empty' $OUTDIR/config.json`, etc.). Precedence: `inputs.model` > `models.<tier>` > table default.

## IMPORTANT: MODE-BASED EXECUTION

Check the `Execution mode` in the Review Context above.

### MODE: review
You are running as a parallel worker for a specific angle.
- The `Target angle` in Review Context is the only angle you must audit.
- Do NOT post inline comments.
- Do NOT update the PR body or title.
- Do NOT manage labels.
- Run ONLY Phase 2 below for your target angle.
- Write findings to `$OUTDIR/findings.<angle>.json` (default `$OUTDIR/findings.<angle>.json`) and then EXIT.
- The findings file MUST be a JSON array only — starts with `[`, ends with `]`, no preamble, no markdown fences, no commentary. See *Output Discipline* in `_header.md`. Validate every `line` via `scripts/resolve-diff-line.sh` and drop findings the helper rejects.

### MODE: validate
You are running as the final aggregator.
- Read all `$OUTDIR/findings.<angle>.json` files from the disk.
- Perform Phase 3 (Self-Validation) below.
- Perform Phase 4 (Submit Native PR Review) below.
- Do NOT modify the PR title, PR description, or PR labels.
- Exit.

### MODE: full (or detect)
Perform all phases (1 through 4) sequentially.

**OUTDIR handoff.** `$OUTDIR` defaults to a per-project `/tmp/pr-review-<hash>` (derived from the repo's git toplevel by `scripts/resolve-outdir.sh`) so concurrent reviews of different repos on one machine never share a tree. Resolve it ONCE in the orchestrator — `source "$WOO_REVIEW_ACTION_PATH/scripts/resolve-outdir.sh"` sets and exports `OUTDIR` — then export `OUTDIR` to **every** sub-agent you spawn. Sub-agents prefer the inherited `$OUTDIR`; if it is unset they re-derive via the same helper. Never fall back to a bare `/tmp/pr-review`.

## Phase 1 — Read artifacts + draft summary

Read `$OUTDIR/diff.txt`, `$OUTDIR/meta.json`, `$OUTDIR/angles.txt`. Draft a 1–2 sentence summary, change bullets, files-by-category, optional manual test plan — all destined for the **Review body** in Phase 4. Do NOT call `gh pr edit`; the PR title and description must remain untouched.

## Phase 2 — Per-Angle Audit (chunk-aware)

If `$OUTDIR/chunks.txt` exists (issue #14), the unit of work is `(angle, chunk_id)` rather than plain angle: each agent reads `$OUTDIR/diff.chunk-<id>.txt` and writes findings to `$OUTDIR/findings.<angle>.<chunk_id>.json`. When `chunks.txt` is absent, the angle agent uses `diff.txt` and `findings.<angle>.json` as before.

For each angle in `$OUTDIR/angles.txt` (× each chunk when chunked):

- If the OpenCode runtime supports parallel subagents, spawn one subagent per `(angle, chunk_id)` (or per angle in the unchunked case) in parallel.
- Otherwise run them sequentially in listed order.

Each angle agent:

1. Loads `$WOO_REVIEW_ACTION_PATH/prompts/angles/<angle>.md`.
2. Executes the angle prompt against its assigned diff. For `react` run `npx -y react-doctor@$REACT_DOCTOR_VERSION --diff $BASE_REF --offline`.
3. Writes findings to `$OUTDIR/findings.<angle>.json` (or `findings.<angle>.<chunk_id>.json` in chunked mode) — JSON array per the schema in `_header.md`.

Stay within each angle's scope; do not let one angle flag issues that belong to another. `merge-findings.sh` (Phase 3) handles within-angle dedup across chunks.

**Retry-once recovery.** Subagents can die mid-run (stream errors, turn-limit interrupts) and leave no findings file. After Phase 2 reports done, before invoking `merge-findings.sh`, scan `$OUTDIR/angles.txt` (× `chunks.txt` when chunked) and check that each expected `findings.<angle>.json` (or `findings.<angle>.<chunk_id>.json`) exists and parses as a JSON array via `jq -e 'type == "array"'`. For any path that fails the check, re-spawn THAT `(angle, chunk)` subagent ONCE with the same brief and model slug. Cap is one retry total per pair — if the retry also fails, leave the file as-is and proceed to Phase 3. The merge step's recovery handles malformed JSON; missing files just mean the angle produced no findings.

## Phase 3 — Adversarial Validation (prosecutor + defender, sequential)

Merge all `findings.<angle>.json` into `$OUTDIR/raw_findings.json` via `$WOO_REVIEW_ACTION_PATH/scripts/merge-findings.sh`. Validation does NOT parallelize; it runs the two opposing-bias passes in sequence, followed by a deterministic intersection (issue #13). Read `disable_adversarial` first:

```bash
DISABLE_ADV="$(jq -r '.disable_adversarial // false' $OUTDIR/config.json 2>/dev/null || echo false)"
```

### Phase 3a — Prosecutor pass (skip if `DISABLE_ADV == true`)

If the OpenCode runtime supports per-call routing, spawn a `deep`-tier subagent with `$WOO_REVIEW_ACTION_PATH/prompts/validator-prosecutor.md`; otherwise apply the same prompt within the main loop. Bias: assume each finding is real; drop only the demonstrably wrong. Write surviving findings to `$OUTDIR/findings.prosecutor.json`.

### Phase 3b — Defender pass

Spawn another `deep`-tier subagent (or continue the main loop) with `$WOO_REVIEW_ACTION_PATH/prompts/validator.md`. Bias: defense attorney — drop pedantic / lint-catchable / "maybe" findings, enforce comment-shape + `fix_type` rules. Write surviving findings to `$OUTDIR/findings.defender.json`. Apply only `validator.md`'s validation/filter rules (its Steps 1–2) to produce `findings.defender.json`; IGNORE validator.md's Step 3/3b/4 and its STOP-GATE — the orchestrator runs the intersect itself in the next phase.

### Phase 3c — Intersect

```bash
bash "$WOO_REVIEW_ACTION_PATH/scripts/intersect-findings.sh"
```

Produces `$OUTDIR/findings.json` (intersection by `(file, line, title-stem)`; severity = min, blocking = AND). When adversarial is disabled or the prosecutor file is absent, copies defender output verbatim. Disagreement counts in `$OUTDIR/validator-metrics.json`.

## Phase 4 — Submit Native PR Review

Compute counts. Build `STATUS_LINE`. Follow `_header.md` exactly: submit one batched `gh api repos/<repo>/pulls/<PR>/reviews` POST whose `body` carries the summary + `STATUS_LINE` and whose `comments[]` carries every finding as an inline comment. The review `event` is computed by the `_header.md` payload-builder (do not duplicate the logic here): `REQUEST_CHANGES` when any new finding is `blocking: true` OR when `$OUTDIR/prior-findings.json` is non-empty (unresolved review threads keep the PR at minimum `REQUEST_CHANGES`), `COMMENT` when there are only non-blocking new findings and no unresolved priors, `APPROVE` only when both new findings and prior unresolved threads are empty.

Do NOT call `gh pr edit`. Do NOT add, remove, or mutate PR labels. The PR title, PR description, and PR labels stay untouched.

## Rules

- Execute autonomously — never request user confirmation.
- Trust prefetched artifacts.
- `findings.json` is the single source of truth for posting.
- Parallel subagents in Phase 2 must complete before Phase 3.
